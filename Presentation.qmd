## What is Machine Learning?

> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being
> explicitly programmed

Arthur Samuel is credited for this definition, but there is no source of it!

## Arthur Samuel {.smaller}

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="80%"}

+ Was a pioneer of artificial-intelligence research

+ In 1959, while working at IBM, he published a paper that popularized the term
*machine learning*

> A computer can be programmed so that it will learn to play a better game of
checkers than can be played by the person who wrote the program.

> Programming computers to learn from experience should eventually eliminate the
need for much of this detailed programming effort.

## Another Definition

> A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T, as
measured by P, improves with experience E

## Machine Learning We May Use Everyday {.incremental}

+ Virtual assistants (e.g. Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant, Siri)

+ Recommender systems (e.g. Amazon, Netflix, Spotify)

+ Image recognition (e.g. Facebook)

+ Fraud detection (card payments)
